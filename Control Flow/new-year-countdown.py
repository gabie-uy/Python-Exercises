# New Year Countdown â€“ Loops

'''
    Ring in the New Year! A New Year's Eve party doesn't feel complete without a countdown from 10 to 0.

    Use a for loop and the range() function for a countdown.

    The output should look like:

    10
    9
    8
    7
    6
    5
    4
    3
    2
    1
    Happy New Year! ðŸ¥³

    Counting down from 10 to 1 on each line and then a Happy New Year message at the end.

    Note: Feel free to end your message with any emoji you want!

for i in range(10, 0, -1): 
  print(i)
print('Happy New Year! ðŸ¥³')
