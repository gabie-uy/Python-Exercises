# Planet Weights â€“ Control Flow

'''
    The year is 2199... we have become an interplanetary species and can travel to other planets in the solar system! ðŸš€

    Create a weight conversion program that:

    Asks the user what their Earth weight is (as a float).
    Asks the user for a planet number (as an int).
    Then, use an if/elif/else statement to calculate the user's weight on the destination planet.

    To calculate the user's weight:

    destination weight = Earth weight Ã— relative gravity
    Number	Planet	Relative Gravity
    1	Mercury	0.38
    2	Venus	0.91
    3	Mars	0.38
    4	Jupiter	2.53
    5	Saturn	1.07
    6	Uranus	0.89
    7	Neptune	1.14
    If the user enters a planet number outside of 1 - 7, print a message that says 'Invalid planet number'.
