# Dog Years â€“ Function

'''
    People say that every year of a dog's life is roughly equal to seven years of a human's life. ðŸ¥²

    Write a dog_years() function that takes two parameters:

    name (string)
    age (integer)
    It should calculate and return a string featuring the dog's name as well as its age in human years.

    For example, if the dogs Landon, Red, and Cooper were 3, 6, and 2 years old respectively, the output would look like:

    dog_years('Landon', 3)
    dog_years('Red Bean', 6)
    dog_years('Cooper', 2)

    # Output:
    # Landon is 21 years old in human years.
    # Red Bean is 42 years old in human years.
    # Cooper is 14 years old in human years.

def dog_years(name, age):
    human_age = age * 7
    return f"{name} is {human_age} years old in human years."

print(dog_years('Landon', 3))
print(dog_years('Red Bean', 6))
print(dog_years('Cooper', 2))
